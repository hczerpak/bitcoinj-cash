### Welcome to bitcoinj-cash

The bitcoinj.cash library is a Java implementation of the Bitcoin cash protocol. This library is a fork of Mike Hearn's original bitcoinj library aimed at supporting the Bitcoin cash eco-system.

It allows maintaining a wallet and sending/receiving transactions without needing a full blockchain node. It comes with full documentation and some example apps showing how to use it.

If there is something that needs to be updated or fixed, please create an issue.

### Technologies

* Java 7 for the core modules, Java 8 for everything else (also compiles and runs under JRE/JDK 11 or 12)
* [Maven 3+](http://maven.apache.org) - for building the project
* [Google Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/google/protobuf) - for use with serialization and hardware communications

### Getting started

To get started, it is best to have the latest JDK and Maven installed.

#### Building from the command line

To perform a full build use
```
mvn clean package
```
You can also run
```
mvn site:site
```
to generate a website with useful information like JavaDocs.

The outputs are under the `target` directory.

#### Building from an IDE

Alternatively, just import the project using your IDE. [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) has Maven integration built-in and has a free Community Edition. Simply use `File | Import Project` and locate the `pom.xml` in the root of the cloned project source tree.

If using JDK 11 or above, the WalletTemplate demo you will JavaFX-SDK installed and referenced seperately. In IntelliJ, add javafx-lib path to File > Project Structure > Libraries. Under Run > Edit Configurations, add '--module-path "PATH_TO_FX" --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml' to VM options. Replace PATH_TO_FX with javafx lib path, leaving the quotations.

### Example applications

These are found in the `examples` module.

#### Forwarding service

This will download the block chain and eventually print a Bitcoin address that it has generated.

If you send coins to that address, it will forward them on to the address you specified.

```
  cd examples
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=cash.bitcoinj.examples.ForwardingService -Dexec.args="<insert a bitcoin address here>"
```

Note that this example app *does not use checkpointing*, so the initial chain sync will be pretty slow. You can make an app that starts up and does the initial sync much faster by including a checkpoints file; see the documentation for
more info on this technique.
